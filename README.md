# Positronic

**Positronic** is a high-performance, block-based terminal environment engineered for privacy, speed, and local intelligence.

Unlike commercial alternatives that offload processing to the cloud, Positronic is architected to run entirely on your metal. It leverages a strict workspace separation—**Core** (State), **Bridge** (UI), and **Neural** (AI)—to deliver a modern terminal experience that respects your data and utilizes your local NPU hardware.

### Key Objectives
*   **Zero Telemetry:** Your commands never leave `localhost`.
*   **Hardware Native:** Built in Rust 1.93 for raw performance and memory safety.
*   **Local Intelligence:** Direct integration with AMD Ryzen AI (Lemonade) for latency-free, private command assistance.
